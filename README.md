# MOCCS

Motif Centrality Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MOCCS) is a method for for clarifying DNA-binding motif ambiguity.

Given ChIP-Seq data of any DNA-binding proteins including transcription factors, MOCCS comprehensively analyzes and describes every $k$-mer that is bound by the DNA-binding proteins.

MOCCS (version 2.0) is written in Perl and R.  
MOCCS was tested on Perl version 5.26.2 and R version 3.6.0.


## Version history

- 2019/06/14: Version 2.0.
	- Added MOCCS2 score in the output (See below for MOCCS2 score).
	- MOCCS now generates a plot of cumulative relative frequency curves of top k-mer sequences based on MOCCS2 score, in addition to that based on AUC.
- 2016/04/15: Version 1.7.
	- Added 'stranded' option. With this optin, MOCCS will count k-mers on the forward strand and will not reverse-complement k-mers. This is useful when analyzing RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) data (e.g. CLIP-Seq data).
	- Added '--low-count-threshold' option.

## Usage

	perl MOCCS.pl -i <string> -k <int>|--regex <string> \
		[--label <string>] [--mask] [--threshold <float>]

- `-i <string>`: FASTA file containing fixed-length sequences around transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) identified by ChIP-Seq. If the file name ends with `.gz`, the file is treated as gzipped FASTA. If `-i stdin` is specified, MOCCS receive FASTA from the standard input.
	- We recommend to use genomic sequences ¬±350 bp around the TFBSs.
- `-k <int>`: Length of k-mers to calculate AUCs. Mutually exclusive with `--regex`.
	- We recommend to set k to 5, 6, 7, or 8.
- `--regex <string>`: (Optional) Regular expression (e.g. CANNTG). When this option is specified, MOCCS calculates AUCs for only k-mers corresponding to the regular expression. Currently, 'N' is interpreted as {A,C,G,T}. Mutually exclusive with `-k`.
- `--label <string>`: (Optional) Label used as the prefix of output files. Default is 'MOCCS_result'.
- `--mask`: (Optional) Mask lower-case characters in fasta file as 'N'.
- `--threshold <float>`: (Optional) Only print k-mers with AUCs higher than this value.
- `--stranded`: (Optional) Count k-mers on the forward strand. This is useful when you analyze sequences bound by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) (e.g. CLIP-Seq data). By default, MOCCS sums counts of a k-mer and its reverse-complement before calculation of the AUC score.
- `--low-count-threshold <float>`: (Optional) Set the low-count threshold. Those k-mers whose counts are less than this value will be filtered. By default, MOCCS set the low-count threshold to `N * (w - k + 1) / 4^k`.

Note that `MOCCS_visualize.r` must be located on the same directory as `MOCCS.pl`.

## Example
### Calculate AUCs for all 6-mers

## AUC and MOCCS2 score
MOCCS (since version 2.0) calculates AUC and MOCCS2 score for each k-mer sequence.

**AUC** is the area under the cumulative relative frequency curve of the appearance of each k-mer sequence against distance from TFBSs, which represents sharpness of the histogram of its appearance around TFBSs. Note that the AUC becomes larger if the shape becomes sharper.

Let $f(x)$ be the appearance count of each k-mer sequence at the position  $¬±x$ bp away from TFBSs and $x \in [1,d]$, then the cumulative relative frequency distribution $F(x)$ for the k-mer sequence is calculated as follows:

$$F(x) = \frac{\sum_{i \in [1,x]} f(i)}{\sum_{j \in [1,d]}f(j)}$$
and its AUC is calculated as follows:
$$\textrm{[AUC]} = \sum_{1 \leq x \leq d} \Bigl(F(x) - \frac{x}{d}\Bigr).$$


**MOCCS2 score** is a relative value of AUC normalized by the standard deviation (SD) at its appearance count.

Let $C$ be the appearance count of the k-mer sequence and let $W$ be the size of the analyzed window where k-mer sequences are sought at around ChIP-seq peak positions, MOCCS2 score is defined as follows:

$$\textrm{[MOCCS2 score]} = \textrm{[AUC]} / \textrm{[SD of AUC]} = \textrm{[AUC]} \times \frac{\sqrt{12C}}{W}$$

The calculation of [SD of AUC] was mathematically derived as follows:

If a k-mer sequence appears only once at a random position within the window, its coordinate follows the uniform distribution $U(0, W)$, whose variance is known to be $W^2 / 12$. Because i) AUC is calculated by subtracting $W / 2$ from the coordinate and ii) constant subtraction does not affect variance of probability distributions, variance of AUC is also $W^2 / 12$ if the appearance count is $1$.

Next, assume that a k-mer sequence appears $C$ times at random positions within the window. The variance of the sum of their coordinates becomes $CW^2 / 12$, because variance of sum of random variables that follow the same probability distribution is proportional to the numbers of the variables.  Then, because AUC is calculated by dividing the sum of their coordinates by C and subtracting $W/2$, the variance of AUC is

$$(CW^2 /12)/C^2 =W^2 /12C ,$$

if the appearance count is $C$. Finally, we obtain [SD of AUC] by taking the square root of the variance:

$$[ùëÜùê∑ ùëúùëì ùê¥ùëàùê∂] = \frac{ùëä}{\sqrt{12C}}$$

In the current implementation of MOCCS2, $W$ was set to `floor((sequence_length - 1)/2) + 1 ‚Äì floor(k / 2)`. Note that since the value of $W$ is the same for every $k$-mer, the relative ranks among k-mer sequences are not affected by the choice of the definition of $W$.
